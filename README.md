# glitch-soc-builder

This repository automatically builds a container image for the [glitch-soc](https://github.com/glitch-soc/mastodon) fork of Mastodon.

I may or may not use this image.
You probably shouldn't.
I make no representations with regard to being up-to-date, functional, maintained, or available long-term.
